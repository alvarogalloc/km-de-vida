# Ai report

- used chatGPT and copilot for the following tasks:
  + mock data because we lack a db
  + generate auxiliary classes for our colour palette
  + apply consistency of style to other components
  + creating layouts using bootstrap for contact page + volunteer forms


# how to run
- run `npm i ` to install dependencies
- run `npm run start ` to start server
- run `npm run dev ` to start server with hot-reload

# deployment
our service is currently deployed  [here](https://km-de-vida.onrender.com/)

# To-do
We have to remove the previously used .html files, but our deployment works and we don't want to touch it right now
