        <h2 class="mb-3">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Food waste is a worldwide problem. Here in Guadalajara there is up to
          a 25% waste across the whole food production chain. That means that a
          quarter of all the food that we produce (grow, process and distribute)
          never even reaches people’s plates.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that, perfectly edible meals also end up in the trash
          because of overproduction, severe quality standards and other
          inefficiencies in places such as restaurants, hotels, supermarkets.
          Even in our homes we contribute to that problem. Households are the
          main source of food waste in Mexico, caused by reasons such as
          overbuying, poor storage, or not checking expiration dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, foster homes, shelters, orphanages, and similar
          institutions frequently struggle to provide enough meals for children,
          the homeless, and other vulnerable people.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we can see, the problem is not the lack of food, but rather the
          poor logistics to distribute it efficiently. We have in our hands a
          huge opportunity to build a solution that can help reduce both
          problems.

        <h2 class="mb-3">Why Kilómetros de Vida?</h2>
        <p>
          This idea came to mind when trying to choose a project where a web
          application would aid in fulfilling at least one of the UN’s
          Sustainable Development Goals. While focusing on the needs of our own
          community in Guadalajara, the UN’s second goal of
          <strong>Zero Hunger</strong> immediately came to mind.

          According to a 2020 study by the Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito
          Público, 23.3% of Guadalajara’s metropolitan population lives in
          moderate poverty, and 1.53% lives in extreme poverty. That means that
          over 1,200,000 people lack food security. Enough food is produced in
          Guadalajara to feed its entire population — the problem lies in
          distribution, which leads to waste. This connects directly to SDG 12:
          <strong>Responsible Consumption and Production</strong>.

          Everyone in our university is aware that we are among the privileged
          few with access to private education. Most of us have not and will
          never face the challenges we describe, but we have observed that many
          people want to help, they just don’t know how.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website aims to bridge that gap: connecting volunteers with
          organizations and donations, helping move food from point A to point B
          — food that would otherwise go to waste. All that is needed is a car
          and time.
